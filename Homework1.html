  <h5><b>A Pragmatic Programmer - Software Entropy</b></h5>
  
  <p>
  The section from the reading that stood out to me the most was the section on Software Entropy. 
  This section of the chapter gave me some insight on how there is a lot more to programming and software then just typing commands. 
  The success of any project can be determined by the mindset and perception of those working on it, and this is made apparent with the broken window metaphor. 
  One small error in a project can cause more errors to stack, so it is best to work on errors as they appear. 
  The section also told the story of firefighters rushing into a fire to cover an expensive carpet before putting out the fire to ensure that they did not ruin the carpet. 
  Any piece of code that presents a mess will cause proceeding programmers to not work as hard because there is already an imperfect code.

  This section stood out to me because it gave me some food for thought when it comes to working with a team on a project in the future. 
  I have to be responsible, pull my weight and not let any errors, no matter how small they may seem, make an impact on the project. 
  It made me aware that a programmer's mindset can make a big impact on a project. 
  If they are unwilling to fix broken windows or are willing to mess up the carpet when putting out a fire, metaphorically speaking, they can allow other careless errors to be made and make their project worse. 
  It should be important to be willing to work with the team in order to prevent a large amount of entropy or chaos within the project.
